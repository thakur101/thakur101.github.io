    Savebirds.com started when we noticed a serious issue with domestic birds being set 'free' when their owners could not care for them anymore. It would lead them to a sad and early death. We decided to make an easy way to give these birds a better home. We have saved hundreds of birds and rehomed them to very loving pet parents where they can live long and healthy lives.

    <h1>How we do it</h1>
    <div class="secondtext">
      When we get a call from a pet parent who's tells us they can no longer keep their bird we immediately ask when they would like us to pick them up or when they can drop off the bird. After we get all the information we can, we call all our associates to see who has room and who would like to take the bird to their home. After we find a foster home we pick up the bird and send them to their tempoary guardians. Then after we get them settled and heal them if they come sick or injured. After the birds are back up to 100% we show them off as much as possible. We get to know their personalities and everything that makes them sweet lovable animals. Then we set up interviews and meet ups with potential adopters. After we decide who could take care of a particular bird the best we send them off to their new happy life!
