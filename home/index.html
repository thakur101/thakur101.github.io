    Savebirds.com started when we noticed a serious issue with domestic birds being set 'free' when their owners could not care for them anymore. It would lead them to a sad and early death. We decided to make an easy way to give these birds a better home. We have saved hundreds of birds and rehomed them to very loving pet parents where they can live long and healthy lives.
